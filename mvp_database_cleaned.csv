Unique dishes, amazing draft list + cocktail menu."",Everything is good but i had one problem with this restaurant and thats idk why you guys didnt mentioned on your menu that you have the best burger ever!!!! ,""I came for the first time tonight, it's beautiful inside and the food is incredible Mussels, Nashville chicken buns, and the salted caramel tart were too notch. Our server Leah was amazing! Cannot recommend enough."",""Used to be one of my favorite places. Unfortunately, I won't be going back. Manager left early for the night, chef wanted to close the kitchen early because it was a slow night, so we were pressured to pick our food so quickly, and when we asked for extra crackers for the cheese, they would not give us. It's not the customers' fault if the restaurant is having a slow night, we are paying to eat and enjoy our evening, not to be treated poorly. The waitress was kind enough but could not do anything because she had no authority apparently."",""My wife and I are huge fans of Brighton Bodega. We love taking friends and family here to experience the best restaurant our neighborhood has to offer. Bodega provides an elevated yet comfortable atmosphere, incredibly creative and delicious menu options, and outstanding service. We have dined here several times, but the most recent experience in December was our most memorable. Our server, Ana, went above and beyond to help us curate our dinner, providing thoughtful suggestions based on dishes we enjoyed in the past and rotating selections that would be tough for us to miss. We love Bodega!"",""Great staff, fun shareable food, menu changes enough to keep it interesting - reliable and good"",""Consistently great. Been here several times and the food, menu options, and service is always excellent"",""Second visit to Brighton Bodega, and we really enjoyed it again. By the name, you wouldn't think it has an Asian bent to it, and I kept thinking there would be tacos, but alas no. Chrysanthemum Caear salad isn't for everyone. Appreciate the creativity, and I liked it, but the greens will throw off most people, especially if you like Caesars. The steamed bun sandwiches are really tasty. Nashville chicken has a good kick. The double patty smash burger was presented so well, and my son enjoyed it. Their French fries are killer. My husband had the crispy chicken fried rice which was a generous portion. Very tasty! Shrimp chips are an odd addition. I had the duck lettuce wraps which were good, but not your traditional lettuce wraps. Needed real lettuce cups to scoop the mixture. The duck was just a titch salty. My Fire Flower tequila cocktail was really tasty and spicy! All in all, I would go back regularly to this fun bodega! Be warned, really hard to find parking in the area!"",""Very cramped ( small ) dark its not Brighton Center ? Ugly the Bodega cheesy . Good was decent ,hostess rude or to busy in her phone ? Price Average . It's a place you would walk by in touristy area n get decent food n go. Not appealing, not place for date or 1 on 1 ."",Great food and free drinks. Everything was interesting and slightly different than normal. The sprouts were a little underwhelming being so small made them kinda hard and flavor didn't penetrate like larger ones.,The food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful.,Excellent food and great atmosphere.,""Best restaurant in Boston. Fusion food with a menu that varies frequently, with really good quality ingredients. Tried the spicy vegetable noodles and a cauliflower dish that were absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is nice but not pretentious and service is very good. Best oysters you can find around here.

Told me they're only doing online orders after 20 mins of waiting and took forever, I can see at least seven staff members just walking around doing nothing and every customer walking in is confused. Would recommend going to a different location."",I love chipotle,Worst customer service I've ever experienced. They're not trained to interact with customers (specifically 2 male employees) and insult the customer instead. Will never return and will gladly go to Shopper's World Chipotle instead.,This is a very clean Chipotle. Joanna from the staff was really nice.,Great food and quick service,""Great location if you want wimpy burritos, poor wrapping, dry chicken, and questionable staff. If you are someone who enjoys paying more for less, this location is for you!"",Worst place to get your burritos! Absolutely horrible employees work here. Never listen to what you are asking to add your orders!!,""The most horrible experience of my life, a woman named Natshlie, who calls herself a Manager, treats employees horribly. I observed her for a long time and she never helped the team. They should fire her. She overwhelmed the employees in a horrible way. She never helped or showed any respect towards anyone."",this chipotle is consistently great and much better than some of the chipotles i've been to,Excelente servicio...,Deen or Dean is the name of the gentleman that helped me and my brother last night and by far the best experience I've had from a Chipotle location I'm from Florida and I can tell you I've never felt so welcomed to a food establishment like this one. I really appreciate the people here ! God bless,""The food was disgusting the smoked brisket and the rice was undercooked and chewy,and the service is definitely not better than there food"",""Honestly, I am appalled by the management at this Chipotle location. I came in during a busy time and saw the staff completely overwhelmed, struggling to keep up with the demand. Many of them were clearly doing their best but had limited English skills, which made communication difficult for both the customers and themselves. The line was getting longer by the minute, and it was obvious they needed extra support. But where was the manager? Sitting in his office, ignoring the chaos and the needs of his team."
It's outrageous to see someone in a managerial position doing absolutely nothing to help his employees during such a busy time. This man is supposed to be the leader, yet he is failing his team and the customers. The staff deserves a manager who will step up and help them succeed. This manager is completely unqualified and incompetent for the role. If this is what management looks like here, I won't be returning anytime soon!
"Spoke to him to give him a word of advice and he got supper defensive and said he was going to leave. Serioulsy you guys need a new manager at this location asap!!!!!!"",They were out of a lot of options and they didn't seem to care.,""I went the other day and it was disgusting how unclean it was. Food mashed all over the floor behind the counter. The grill looked like food had been caked on for several days in the corners. The counter where my burrito was made had food smeared all over it and wasn't cleaned between food assembly. The restaurant itself was freezing cold. It was cold outside and the AC was on full blast inside. The eating area needed to be mopped and wiped down. I've worked in fast food, it's NOT that difficult to take care of these things. The guy who took my order was cordial enough. I had planned to sit down but I was kind of grossed out to stay. I almost walked out and I should have. The burrito definitely didn't have as much meat as it should have. Guys, the place was a pig sty. Fix it"",They never have anything they always run out early. Its not like i walk in 30 min before close. They run out 4 hrs before closing..,""Thai place is so dirty the trash was full and nobody came to change. The food was so cold and it was really disgusting. They also didn't change their gloves they were touching so many stuff that was dirty. The customer service was horrible they were really rude, and unprofessional."",""Was my first time trying Chipotle, and I can say with confidence I was not disappointed. I had ordered delivery and they made the food in a timely manner, they finished making my food after 8 minutes of ordering, which is pretty good. The food itself came nothing short of amazing. The bowl which I had ordered had good portions, packed well with no mess, and included napkins and utensils even though I forgot to order them. Although it was not the actual location, everything else about this Chipotles's food was great."",The portions are very small,""HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE from the lady on the line. Nothing but attitude , and assume what I wanted on my taco made the taco sloppy"",""I wish I could give zero stars! This place is TERRIBLE & DISGUSTING!!!! Save your money, go to 5 guys right next door or take the 5 minute drive up to the chipotle in shoppers world!!!! You'll be happy you did. This place has extremely rude employees! No one greets you, absolutely no customer service whatsoever. The place is absolutely disgusting!! Never clean, food particles everywhere. Their food bar is riddled with cross contamination. I've never walked into this place and seen it clean. Judging by the other reviews, the lack of care seems to start at the manager level and just trickle down to the rest of the crew. The food is just slapped onto your bowl or burrito, one of the most if not the worst food presentation I've ever seen. I made an order on DoorDash where I paid for a steak burrito and also paid for extra chicken. I received minimal amount of chicken and no steak! Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague!!!!!"",""Consistently one of the dirtiest Chipotle's. Like, I doubt anyone comes out from behind the counter and cleans."
Staff is combative. They act like putting half a scoop of rice and half a scoop of beans is doing you a favor.
"Skip this one and hit Shoppers World."",""I am writing to express my disappointment with the unacceptable service we received at the Natick Chipotle. Our experience was especially negative due to the behavior of the manager, Kai, who was both rude and unprofessional."
"To my surprise, we were informed by Kai that there were """"limits"""" on what I could add to my bowl/burrito, something I have never encountered at any other Chipotle location. It seemed as though they were making up policies on the spot, which I believe goes against Chipotle's standardized franchise procedures. As a loyal customer, I have always appreciated Chipotle's consistency across locations, so this deviation was both unexpected and frustrating."
I would appreciate it if a representative from Chipotle's corporate team could contact me to address this issue and clarify whether this location has special policies that allow such discrepancies.
My experience at this location was far from what I have come to expect from Chipotle, and I believe this warrants further attention.
"Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from someone regarding this matter."",I avoid coming here. They always mess up the order or forget something I asked/paid for. The general manager (kai) is also really rude.,Efficient nice location who gets the orders right. My boys enjoy getting served by Davis/Dee. What a nice guy who provides excellent customer service. I hope Chipotle recognizes his efforts taken care of guest. Thank you Dee for all you do for my boys.,This restaurant blows. Customer service is even worse. Order never ready when you arrive.,Worst Chipotle location! Every time that I order they never put the online orders on the shelf. You have to try to get someone's attention and usually they just ignore you. After standing for 10 minutes in the store and being ignored by the 4 people working I went behind the counter and looked for my order that had been ready before I got there. There were 2 women working the online order station and one of them helped multiple other customers that had not ordered ahead of time but didn't acknowledge the 4 people trying to pickup online orders. This store has a serious issue with management and common sense.,Great fast food.,Found a hair in my food,""a week ago i had a disappointing experience at Chipotle(Natick location) specifically with a manager named Nashly. Despite her title, she displayed a lack of professionalism that significantly affected my visit. Her behavior and attitude were not up to the standards I expect from Chipotle. It was clear that she is not fit for the role she holds. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and addresses these issues to ensure that all customers receive the quality service Chipotle is known"",""Nashly was so rude not polite"
"The worst employee in whole state"",""My recent experience at Chipotle left much to be desired, primarily due to the unprofessional conduct of the manager, Nashly.

I hope the management takes steps to improve their service quality moving forward."""""
"This review maintains a professional tone while clearly expressing your dissatisfaction with Nashly's behavior"",""My recent visit to Chipotle was marred by an unpleasant encounter with the manager, Nashly. Her demeanor was extremely rude, and she exhibited a significant level of ego. Despite being a loyal customer, I was met with dismissiveness and unprofessional behavior when addressing a simple request.

I hope Chipotle takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue promptly to ensure a more pleasant experience for future patrons"",""My husband is not the complainer type when it comes to food and he likes Chipotle. He went to this place today and was disgusted. The server was making bowls, with gloves on, touched the food, went on to the register, got money from customers, made change to customers, then went back with the same gloves, touched the lettuce, touched the cheese, etc... When it was my husband's time to order, a new girl came, put new gloves on, but the previous guy had already put his dirty/filthy gloves in the cheese container... What's the point of wearing gloves? They MUST be changed after each order if touching the register/money, etc!

The last time, there was ONE guy behind the counter doing everything and he was slow to boot. Had to go elsewhere."",""I am a former employee at this location, and I have been frequenting it recently since the change in management. I have to say, I believe it has gone uphill in quality, tremendously. I'm going to leave the most honest and in-depth review I possibly can."
FOOD - The grill guy matters tremendously at Chipotle. They more or less determine how good everything on the hot side of the line will be. The last few times, I have seen my former coworker Luis cooking the food. I have to commend him and whoever else has been cooking the food for my last few visits.
The Rice - perfect consistency and texture, perfect balance of salt, cilantro, and lime.
The Beans - Luis, or whoever has been cooking the food, absolutely NAILS the beans. The pinto beans are the absolute perfect texture every time I've visited recently. Believe it or not, the BEANS have been the highlight of my bowl every time, just because they are cooked to the right consistency every time - not too watery, not undercooked.
The Meat - I order extra chicken every time, because it is so good at this location. It's perfectly seasoned, and perfectly grilled - JUST enough that it has that salty, spicy, charred edge, without being over the top.
I personally don't care for Queso, or Fajita veggies, but I would bet that they are excellent as well.
SERVICE - The service at this location has really gone uphill, in my opinion. Kai seems like an excellent manager. They served me multiple times, and have been very polite every time, with a smile on their face. They seem to treat their employees and customers with decency and respect. The woman working the line tonight (Monday 9/13) provided excellent service. She was quick and very kind.
Another thing - although Chipotle has become expensive, in my opinion, this location serves very fair portions. Obviously, they can't make your bowl overflow, but I feel that this location does a good job of providing a satisfactory amount of food.
All around, solid service and friendly employees. They make you feel welcome and serve up delicious food.
ATMOSPHERE - This is an honest review, so the ONLY thing I can knock this location on is the Atmosphere. The tables are often dirty, and it's a bit of a recurring issue. And, when I came for dinner tonight, I entered the men's room to wash my hands, only to find a broken faucet. I'm not sure if they'd noticed the broken faucet, but there are well-stocked hand sanitizer dispensers in the restaurant that provided an alternative. Plus, it's not like the employees were sitting around on their phones; everyone was working the entire time I sat and ate my bowl. They were trying their best, and I noticed.
"In conclusion, if you want to go to a location that embodies Chipotle Mexican Grill, not high schoolers serving chicken and rice that tastes like water come to this one. You won't be disappointed with the food or the service."",""Fast service, great lunch spot! Good food."",Oof,""Comida carssima. Pedi um prato chamado churrasco e dei risada quando vi. Se voc quiser comer churrasco, v a um restaurante brasileiro em Framingham. L, se paga mesmo preo e voc come churrasco de verdade, com fartura."",The Staff here are unprofessional. Ended up walking out as I was ordering.,""Whoever that female is that's working right now or maybe not right now but at 2:40pm on Tuesday sept 5th is a huge btc cause I was nothing but nice and fast w my order and she acted like she was being forced to take my order and even worst didn't even mark my burritos, 2 burritos basically the same just one thing different and doesn't mark it then takes for ever to give me my change back, do y'all check for elementary-level math atleast to be a cashier cause even tho it tells you how much you owe back she was having the hardest time to figure it out. Bottom line food was good for the price, the watermelon limonada was good, the customer service was dog fecal matter. Hopefully never have to see her there again."",""I ordered my food at 1:20pm, and pick it up at 1:50pm. I stayed until 2:20 p.m. waiting for my order."
Very disorganized team. Dirty floor.
"Terrible place to order food."",Much better than 5 Guys around the corner. First time there and I was impressed.,DO NOT EAT HERE - my 6 year old has found PLASTIC PIECES in her food twice in the last month. Thank God she found it. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND DISGUSTING. When I call to tell someone no one answers. Hmm I wonder why. Get this FIXED we will not eat here again,If only they didn't put cilantro on everything...,""Consistently good food, quick service. It's a little frustrating that you can not buy a quesadilla as an individual item, as it used to be, now must be part of a package with 3 sides= extra money..."",""The food is okey. But since they provide table and chair for people to eat in, they seriously need to hire someone to constantly clean the table and floor during high hour. Like 5, 6 in the afternoon. The table and floor condition become unacceptable after 6 as people eat on table and no one is doing cleaning."",Below average as far as the Chipotle chain goes. We try to avoid going here whenever possible in favor of locations further away because they do aixh better job with the food elsewhere.,""Boston King was here"

I had an amazing dining experience at Conrads, Needham. From start to finish, everything exceeded expectations.
First, the steakwow. It was cooked to absolute perfection, juicy, tender, and full of flavor. Every bite melted in my mouth, making it one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The salad was soo good as well.
The fried pickles were just as impressive. Crispy on the outside, tangy on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. They disappeared from the table way too fast!
The calamari was a surprise. At first glance, it didn't look the most appetizing, but don't let that fool you. The taste was goodlight, crispy, and paired with the perfect dipping sauce. Definitely worth ordering.
To top it off, our server Jamie made the experience even better. She was all smiles, attentive, and checked in on us frequently without being overbearing.
"Overall, a fantastic meal with great food and even better service. I'll definitely be back!"",Great addition to Needham!,""I am so pleased that it Is opened now! When I come home for March break I'll definitely get the chance to come and eat at conrad's"

The staff was amazing from helping to organize beforehand through service day of. The menu provided options for everyone. They also accommodated children and attendees with special dietary restrictions if needed. They suggested a local establishment to get dessert items from as well which were fantastic."
On the day of the luncheon, the service was exceptional. The waitresses were fast and attentive. The food was served quickly and everyone enjoyed their meals. Attendees were able to select from many options including steak tips, fish and chips, salmon, Caesar salad, chicken parm, or baked scrod.
The price was extremely reasonable. The room set up was done perfectly for our party of 25 people but could accommodate a lot more if we needed.

The sauce they provide is to me what made the sandwich and the fries so good.,""Ladies at the front were pleasant. the fry's are super good and crispy, sliders were pretty good(overhyped). ordered a reaper tender and it was super hot i definitely recommend going mild-hot. also the bathrooms were dirty."",""Quick takeout order turned into an upsetting experience because of one argumentative cashier, who was just so unwilling to help. We already ordered Hot for heat level, but lately the flavor was just not the same. Asked the cashier for little more cajun powder seasoning, either sprinkled on our chicken or on the side. He was just ready to say no, refusing to accommodate for such little request. He kept repeating we should've ordered hot for heat level, which we did, and the entire order had to be remade....Really!? Are we asking for whole new chicken? Are we asking to remake the whole order? Are we asking for whole jar of cajun seasoning? Is your pricing different for heat levels?? Such idiotic attitude from this guy who kept arguing with us for good 5 minutes over this , we were just ready to ask for refund at this point, including the tip ! what are we tipping them for?? Then the other cashier stepped in to help, went to the kitchen to ask for more seasoning - it was that simple. But that's not where it ended. These immature cashier and the cook we could see through open kitchen were giggling and messing around with sprinkling gesture , as if making a mockery of us. Shame on your terrible behavior. How ironic we had some pictures taken for review while waiting for our order, including the two cashiers - the good guy on the left and the bad one on the right. Will just be going to Framingham location."",Really nice cashier and environment,""Was not crowded on Sat evening as before and line was moving fast."
Dave's #1 two tenders with fries $12.99
"Was very tender, good spicy, but portions got much smaller than before. Fries were a bit burnt and salty. For Parking, you are competing with next door TJ maxx customers..."",The food is excellent as always! My pick up order was ready to go when I arrived. The staff were courteous and friendly.

I sincerely recommend that everyone should give themselves a treat and get an outstanding meal at Dave's Hot Chicken!!!,Check in with michael! Great customer service,delicious chicken nice customer service from Chellis,""Dave's hot chicken is so good, everyone knows that. This one is particularly better than the Framingham location in every aspect. I know they have a veggie option out west which I believe is the cauliflower sandwich. This needs to come to the East coast ASAP."",Wonderful service and great food,Loved it!,The reaper heat level taught me why pride is a sin.,They brought the cauliflower back!!! Yeah!!! The chicken was always my son's favorite but we stopped eating there when they got rid of the cauliflower. So happy it's back!!!,Tenders and sliders were . Spice level was on point. This place is better than Canes. Fast and friendly service!,""My family and I love Dave's hot chicken. Their French fries are delicious."
"Unfortunately the service we received at this location while visiting from out of town for the weekend was subpar. The cashier did not acknowledge my daughter and I standing at the counter for a few minutes. When she did come to the counter to help us place our order, she made us feel uncomfortable because of her power attitude."",Terrence was an amazing employee great energy and also energetic,Relatively standard Dave's and has good food. One thing about this place in specific is sometimes I feel they under season their chicken relative to other daves so keep that in mind when ordering. When coming in late it can get very packed with delivery and people so go earlier.,Awesome chicken 10/10 and the fries are also on par overall a great experience,Perfect place to eat i love spicy food so this is my favorite I basically live here that's how much times I've been here,best customer service here ever.,""Great team of people, good product and good service.

When I order the toasted almond shot, they put the swirl in and refuse to fix it. My friend specifically cannot have dairy. It's super frustrating because I'm really clear about what the coffee cannot have in it (dairy) and they keep putting it in. I don't really know what else to do to make sure they get the order correct. And it happens EVERY TIME."",Great experience overall. Fresh coffee and dounuts. It's hard to find good crullers but this placed nailed it!

The location is also very clean and well staffed in general"",love this dunkin always reliable and good :),it's a Dunkin... way too much chocolate on the Boston cream,""Another Dunkin'. This one is renovated and open late. Fine for a quick coffee or a snack."
Dunkin' as a corporation is no longer an especially good food/donut maker. But an early morning mixed dozen on the way to the office is still sure to bring cheer to the morning. Sometimes an egg/cheese croissant with hash browns are in order. Though be warned, shrinkflation got them a long time ago.
"This location has a great staff. They usually invite you up next to order, are friendly, say thank you, etc. Good folks. Enjoy!"",""Very fast service! I used to wait in line, but in all honesty I personally prefer to order in on the app as I can earn points and be quick in and out visit especially on days I'm in a rush to work!

Katrina is always there to greet with a smile.,""i always go with my little sister in the morning and they always are restocked on everything. my sister is a little shy, and the overnight workers are always patient with her. i love coming here so much."",""They always take care of me there, and sometimes I forget to say decaf.. somehow after heart surgery, I am now hypersensitive to caffeine, sending me to the hospital with palpitations. So if I forget, and my hubby checks my cup, they will remake it, no questions asked! It's usually clean to sit and enjoy if I need a break from walking."
"On the recommended dishes ,the need to add Grilled cheese.. that's my Go-to!"",First time I've seen a business with no handle on the front door.. You just kinda grab the edge with your fingers? Cashier had a persistent cough. Hot food was cold.,Open 24/7,One of my favorite DD locations. Cafe Americano is the best and Refreshers are delicious. Especially mango pineapple refresher.,Good service,""Worst dunkin donuts ever! They are always out of everything in the night time. They put cheese in my egg sandwich even tho I asked them not to! Clumsy, lazy af workers! Pay attention! Stupid retards!"",""I don't take time to review places often, especially chains, but this dunkin gave me the single worst coffee I've ever had. My poorest attempts at brewing at home are nothing compared to the sickeningly weak, flavorless black something that was in my cup. It looks and tastes like warm water with black food coloring. Absolutely awful, please go to a different location."",Amazing night time employees got me right before my overnight!!!,The people that work there are very nice.,""Everytime I order a latte here they give me the flavor and the milk with no espresso. When I ask them to fix my order they usually say """"I didn't hear you ask for espresso in the latte."""" Their donuts are always stale even in the early morning and the service is okay at best"",I go here for the iced decaf,""We were staying in the area for an event, and this location was the only place open late, 24 hrs.

"Echo Bridge Restauraunt and Cafe,11AM - 10PM,a little bit cozy,pizza and italian entrees,$20-30,""small business, family owned"",Sit Down,Nice place for a cozy meal!,""Visited for the 4th time recently, and ordered the chicken parm this time. It was so delicious, and they plated our split entree beautifully. Bri an excellent bartender and made the best Mai Tai!"",This is an old school family owned restaurant. Food is all very good and fresh. I have had their food many times in person and via delivery to our office. Tab beer is some of the coldest I have had.,""We attended a birthday celebration for our daughter's friend on """"Music Bingo"""" night at Echo Bridge. I just wanted to share that it was a great event and thank Caroline (the waitress) who went above and beyond. Both Caroline and Mike the MC brought incredible welcoming and positive energy."",""Typical small sports pub, with a large counter and screens. The food is good, but I regret that they've stopped serving Downeast cider"",""Very quiet ambiance. They had my favorite, Heineken, 0.0 (N/A), and enjoyed it."",Good Italian food restaurant. Very friendly staff.,""So the first time I ordered from here I ordered scallops.. which are clearly advertised as """"sea scallops"""". Any seafood lovers out there know there's a very big difference (in size) between sea scallops and fresh water scallops... fresh water scallops are significantly smaller than sea... what I got were very clearly fresh water scallops. I was very disappointed about that, but just kind of let it go. Today I decided to give them a 2nd chance, with a completely different dish. I will never order from here again. I ordered a TWENTY- TWO DOLLAR steak tip sub!! 22$!!! Not including the extra dollar to add cheese and 2$ for the Cajun fries over regular. After tip and everything it came out to almost 35$ (I also got a stuffed quahog). The sub was supposed to be rare to med rare... look at the pics!! That is defs NOT even med rare, let alone rare! The tips are soooo tough it's unreal!! I couldn't even chew it!! Just look at that sub, does that look like a 22$ sub??? I get this same sub from a different place for 14$ and it's AMAZING!!"
And the stuffed quahog.. just wow! I ended up giving it to my boss before I decided to take pics, but I took pics of the shell so you can see how ridiculously small it is. In the pics you can see it's barely bigger than the lemon wedge and there's zero depth to the shell.... which is normally not that big of a deal. Even if the shell isn't super big or deep, they're usually STUFFED and like over flowing. Not these ones! The stuffing was level with the brim of the shell and there literally wasn't a single clam in it at all!! Despite the description explicitly saying there's TONS of clams in it. The layer of stuffing was soooo thin that it was literally crusted to the shell from the cooking process (if you know what I mean, almost like cheese gets when you put it in the oven super long). There was genuinely, MAYBE, 1 1/2 tablespoons TOTAL in the shell!! I was dumbfounded when I opened that bag... if I wasn't at work and out of break time, I'd of returned the food and gotten my $ back!
"The one good thing I'll say is, the quahogs were only 3$. So I guess that's not a terrible price for what I got.... even though the ones that they sell at Stop & Shop grocery store are a buck 50 and they have a minimum of 20+ times the stuffing in them."",A fantastic place with great food and good people I highly reccomend it,Regular costumer,Had Pizza & Beer on Monday Night with a group of Retirees. Still a great place and well run..,""My name is Deborah Klein , I've been going to Mario's since I was 17 , then I moved to the north shore ,and I'm very picky when it comes to my pizzas, I've tried almost every place ,here in Salem Massachusetts, they are all terrible, just a couple of weeks ago I was a friends place for the week , on the way back her boyfriend her , and I stopped in ordered the best pizza in Massachusetts in my book , the people then are fantastic, so now I to come buy once a month to have your pizza , other wise I dont eat pizza anymore . I this place a100+ stars if I could , thank you for the great memories I had there now I'm 58 , pretty scary I hope"
"Clemmy and carol are doing well "",The service and food were great. Definitely going back.,""I've been coming here for a while now, but a recent event impassioned me to leave this review."
Let me start by saying that firstly, the food here is ALWAYS delicious and cooked to perfection. Never have I ever received something done badly, spilled, or over/undercooked.
"Secondly and lastly, the employees and manager here are very kind and understanding. Today, I put in an online order for a pizza, but through either my error or my phone's internet connection error, my comment of """"no mushrooms please!"""" did not attach to the order. When I arrived, my order had mushrooms on and I told them that I had put """"no mushrooms."""" Without fuss, I was told that they would make another pizza for me right away. While I was waiting, I realized that the comment did not attach for some reason, and quickly apologized for my error. They were entirely understanding and even let me keep the second pizza free of charge!"
"This interaction of them """"honoring"""" MY error was wonderful and will keep me coming back for a long time! Combine that with the fact that I heard they give free pizzas to the elementary school students nearby, I gotta say that this restaurant has become one of my favorite places to come to. Delicious food and good company, what more could you ask for!"",""A lovely family neighborhood restaurant with huge portions and great service. Nothing fancy, just a good neighborhood eatery and bar."",We had to take a detour on our way home due to construction one day and passed by Echo. We made it our mission to come back that way and try it out and I am so glad we did!! The food was so comforting and the everyone there was so nice. Our server Ernesto took great care of us and had great suggestions.,""I am giving Echo Bridge 5's primarily for hitting me in the feels. Haven't been here since I was a little kid. Echo Bridge has not changed much since my last trip years ago. If you are looking for fancy or modern, likely not your place. But if you are looking for the crowd who prefers Dunkin, here you go. Echo Bridge has been in business since 1962. It's located across street from Hemlock Reservation where the Echo Bridge over Charles River is located. The falls were running strong yesterday. Food is primarily Italian & they also have American fare (burgers, fries, ..). I had pizza which was huge & loaded with toppings. My husband had a burger which he rates excellent . Drinks are real good & fairly priced. For metro west Boston area prices are lowish. Our waitress was very kind & doing her best. Unfortunately she was only waitress on in dining room on Saturday night. What most amazed me at Echo Bridge is no one had their cell phone's out. Felt like a diner crowd with all shapes, ages, & sizes. People were talking, laughing. Hope they are able to get right staffed soon."",Takeout order. They got order wrong....did not give us what we ordered. The food we got was mediocre.,""I used to hold this place in high esteem. Tonight, it was beyond atrocious. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Echo Bridge has jumped the shark."",Food so so.,""The food is good but basic. There are a lot of choices of typical bar-food. They have Trivia a few nights a week, which is a lot of fun. The drinks are fairly priced. A fun place to meet friends"",""The first time I went here was fun and the food was very good. This was my second time for half-price pizza. It took over an hour to get the wrong pizza toppings. 3 of us ordered 1 pizza each, and 1 pizza came over an hour later with all of the toppings of all 3 pizzas on it. They didn't charge us for that one and """"rushed"""" us the correct order. The server kept apologizing for the delay, but it took about an hour and a half to get the pizzas we ordered. The outer crust was delicious, but the bottom was soggy, and toppings were minimal. I don't recommend the pizza, but the turkey tips were delicious, and our server was great."",""As always, fantastic service and great food !!"",""Great bar for drinks, has a good vibe."
"We went there close to its closing time still the staff was very welcoming"",terrible service and food. Would not be surprised if someone tells me this house is haunted.,""never had a problem, love this place.!!"",I haven't been here since maybe 1986. It was an amazing trip back and some of the best pizza around,""I will never know if the food at this restaurant is good, because of their lack of disability accommodations and acceptance of United States currency for deliveries. As usual, Newton is too rich to care about us poor different people. What a shame. Not a surprise at this point."",""This spot is a bar/food oasis. Came here last minute hoping for the best and got that. Strongly recommend any of the raviolis, they open till 11pm and the vibe is very welcoming."",""Our local restaurant . Great people , great food , great neighbor . I just had them cater a party , every body raved about the food and the price was great !!!!! I was able to enjoy the party and the food made the day."",""Amazing food, reasonably priced and a very welcoming staff. Total gem!"",The food here was AMAZING! I originally came for the Irish pub next store but after seeing the parking lot mainly connected to that restaurant I decided to check this one out. I was so pleased with how fresh everything was and how quickly the food was brought out. Definitely a must stop if you're in town.,""Always good food. I enjoy the throw back atmosphere, and now that they accept cc it's much easier. Never had a bad meal, in fact I look forward to my visits for either the tips or lasagna as they are always great."",""From the west coast this was an awesome Boston experience. Great beer, great service and great chicken wings. Ty for your hospitality."",""This would be a 3.5 if i could.

Plenty of parking around the restaurant as well"",""Strictly mediocre. When you are accustomed or know what good sushi should be like, you will be disappointed. Caterpillar roll had very little unagi and a strange fruity sauce on top and the slices of avocado were paper thin. Spicy scallop roll was fine, just not great. Spicy tuna roll tasted like a supermarket roll. And the salmon nigiri looked and tasted like yesterday's fish."
Friendly staff. Interior decor could be any restaurant - little ambiance.

It can be hard to find restaurants with more than one kind of veggie sushi and they had lots of options. I got the avocado/ cucumber maki and triple A maki. Both were delicious. I also got spicy mayo.. it didn't really taste like mayo to me. The sauce was really dark orange but I was fine with it. More sushi for less money than nori sushi. This was a good find on grubhub!,""I'm on the road for my job and I was in the area. Sushi is usually a go-to of mine so this one popped up and as a photographer, the pictures looked enticing. I did order pretty early and before I could get to pick up my order the owner called to remind me that the order was ready. When I got there he reminded me again that I was late to pick up my order. But the food hit all the right spots and that is the most important seeing that it was take out LOL"",""The menu was terrible ! the staff were on their phones. They don't have any menus.

Prices are very reasonable.,""Maki Madness on Sunday night is a great value, and always high quality. Alaskan, Spicy Tuna, and Negi Hama for us! Good COVID practices, too."",""I have never written a review before, but this is unacceptable."
I ordered two orders of the salmon sushi, totaling to a little over $15. The order arrives and I got only four pieces of sushi.... I called to ask if this was right, and before I could even finish my sentence the waitress rudely interrupted me saying that it's four pieces. She went on to say that the salmon is really expensive these days. I said thank you and hung up the phone.
The fact that she already knew what I was going to ask before I finished my sentence tells me that other people have called the restaurant asking to double check the number of pieces because the prices are astronomical. I will never order from here again and I am still hungry.
Sincerely,
"a broke college student"",""Amazing environment, food and staff. The avocado salad is a must try!"",""SHOCKINGLY BAD. AVOID. Extremely rude manager working on Friday nights. Received wrong order and waited 25 minutes without any updates or apologies. When I finally received the order, I was informed they would not be able to accommodate my request next time for no sesame seeds or soy sauce (I have a life threatening allergy), and they acted if it was my fault for having allergies.

Made the mistake of getting sashimi (it was unbearably hot). Exceedingly low quality fish, forced to spit some cuts out. Service was also lacking."",""We were surprised to find the Great Wok after The Wok was gone for so long. The food was much fresher and better than the Wok. I think the establishment listened to other reviewers as they were friendly, attentive and the food came out quickly. The entrees were prepared well, fresh ingredients and the best local chinese we have had in the suburbs in awhile! We had Spicy Salt & Pepper Shrimp which was lightly breaded and fried perfectly with no extra grease, Schezuan Spicy Beef and Vegetable Fried Rice. Definitely recommend trying it!"",Great lunch special and mai tai!,""Where do I begin. This restaurant was extremely clean, the staff were very welcoming, and there was plenty of Asian decor spread out to add to the ambiance of the experience. I wanted to try some of the more common items to get a feel for this restaurant. Let's talk about the food!"
I started with the Hot & Sour soup. Wow!! This was bursting with flavor and had just enough heat that you feel a little tear forming, but not too much heat that you can't enjoy the flavors. Each spoonful was full of the traditional vegetables found in this soup complimented with the little bites of tofu. This was perfect. Will definitely order it again.
My next bite after having the soup was the bone in spareribs. They were so tender and flavorful. After my first bite I just reflected thinking that these were right up there with some of the best Will definitely order again.
I then moved on to the teriyaki. You could tell that they take their time marinating them. The meat was so flavorful, tender, and had the crisp edges. I don't use a number scale, I will just say they were perfect! Again, I will be back for more.
The next bite was the wings. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. They used just the right amount of aromatics that gave them a subtle, yet delicious flavor. I can usually pinpoint the spices. These had me. Would order them again!
Then the eggrolls! Plenty of celery and pork with a perfect crunch. These were old school amazing eggrolls. Do I have to say it? Yup, I will eat these again, and again.
Lastly, I received a complimentary fried ice cream! The feelings this gave me after my meal is what I equate some people feel when cuddling after relations..
This is by far one of the best places overall that I have been to recently. The menu has traditional Chinese-American dishes, and it also has dishes that are harder to find. I've been told the rice is delicious! They also have a full Japanese sushi menu. The only item not on the menu was the coveted lobster sauce.
I highly recommend this restaurant! I will definitely go back!
Edit: Have been back multiple times. Food is amazing!!!!!
"Great Wok in Wellesley!"",""The staff was very friendly. We ordered 6 different sushi rolls. The rice ratio was perfect and the other ingredients were fresh. We showed up an hour before closing and I didn't know what to expect. Food came out fairly quick too."
"We got complimentary crab rangoons, and they were so kind to give us fried ice cream as well."",This is a lit place to have scorpion bowls and a quick decent meal. It's a good time and you can spend with your fam. Only issue that we had was the waitress kept trying to get us to leave before they even closed.,""Drinks, Food, and Atmosphere! This place is always buzzing, the food looks and taste fresh, and the drinks are hard to say no to. If you're in the area for lunch, dinner or just looking to kill some time, they have a Mango Mai Tai that compliments any occasion."",""I have eaten there many times, and the food is always top notch."",Excellent Ma Po Tofu.,""We only get take out, but best Chinese around. Our favorite is The veggie lo mein, chicken pad Thai and moo shi chicken"",""Bartender was great, we had a blast there."",Usually do take out. Will drive 30 minutes as the food is always great,""I've only had take-out from here. So I can't completely review it properly."
That being said, the food is delicious!!! Very close to the old Chinatown in Boston. Authentic noodles for the appropriate dishes, fresh veggies, and very authentic flavorings!
"Just delicious."",""The moment I bit into the complimentary Crab Rangoon, I could tell something was different about this place. Easily the best Americanized Chinese food I've had in MA."
"Ordered some chicken dish with vegetables. Chicken was tender and vegetables were just the perfect balance between soft with texture. Sauce was also not overbearing with oil or too salty. My friend got the black pepper Beef and he really enjoyed it too. We were both pleasantly surprised. Will be back again soon"",Comida deliciosa,""I've had great dishes at Great Wok very delicious and dependable. They offer very timely delivery service that you can really count on. I would highly recommend Great Wok to anyone looking for a reliable, dependable an authentic Asian food restaurant."",Yummy food and they had to deal with my family who are not easy. They got every dish right which impressed me. Everything we had was hot and tasty.,""I am going to call it average. Not bad, but the seasonings were not to my taste. Nothing gross or dirty (aside from the dusty fake plant in the entrance way) here, so it's worth a try. The quality of ingredients was better than average. For example, there were no fatty chunks in the pork fried rice, just lean pork cubes."",""We were exited to go here based on such great reviews. Last night we finally went to this restaurant. We ordered drinks, took so long for water & a Diet Coke ----- only one of the appetizers came before other stuff. The plates of food are quite small compared to other Chinese places we've been to."
My friend got sushi ----- she said the salmon tasted like freezer-burn! Yuck. I got a Large wonton soup and it arrived literally with only half the bowl full......they should at least fill it with broth!!! ---- which is my favorite part. The pan-fried ravioli were ok, but arrived late and so not hot.
It was nice that they gave a nice desert surprise when they bring the check. The waitress wasn't friendly, at all. I've been a waitress, so I tipped 20%. Maybe she was having a bad day.
"So, sorry to say the food was NOT good and the service worse. I just want to be honest and forthright so people can decide whether or not to try it. It's reasonably priced, but you get what you pay for."",""This restaurant is TERRIBLE. The service is bad. We ordered beef with broccoli, it came out as a 3 pound mass of congealed jelly. Moo Shu Shrimp has 5 tiny shrimps, the rest all cabbage and scallions. The fried spring rolls were still dripping with oil. All the food was insanely salty. I am so sorry, but it's too expensive for such low quality food. The bathroom is not clean. The dining room was overrun with flies and flying insects. Ugh"",Food is always good. Prices have increased a lot.,Only utilized take out service,Ordered catering from the place for a birthday party. Amy was really helpful and helped us pick the dishes and portions. The food was ready on time and tasted good.,""The food was very good, however, they asked repeatedly if we wanted refills on our diet cokes. We said yes two times. They charged us for 6 diet cokes. One time, mine was not even empty when they took it away. To be such a nice restaurant and charge for refills on FOUNTAIN SODA is absurd and disappointing. This practice just frustrates people and takes away from an otherwise good experience."",""Pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. Good atmosphere, friendly service. Excellent Sweet and Sour Fish, Orange Chicken, and pea pod greens."",Very good Chinese food. :),""The best sauteed vegetables ever. Hot, crunchy full of fresh individual veggie tastes. Perfect."",Great food but pricey,""This restaurant is a hidden gem. It's in a sleepy area so people might skip over it but let me tell you that's a mistake. The food is so delicious, the service is amazing and the owners are very sweet/ generous people. It has a nostalgic Chinese American decor which I also can appreciate. It has so many options Chinese food, sushi and even stuff like pad Thai. Usually restaurants who do this are a red flag, but they actually pull it off. Everything tastes amazing. Highly recommend."",""The whole thing was fantastic. Everything about it was great, from the food to the service to the ambiance. Perfect for a night out on the town or a quick drink and snack with friends. I'm looking forward to returning this weekend. At the end, you'll even get some fried ice cream. Yummy, I appreciate it."",""Really incredible service! Decided to try this restaurant on a limb given its high Google Maps rating and was not disappointed. Food is great, prices are very reasonable and the hostess came over many times to check on us. Highly recommend for those in the area!"",Some of the best service I've ever received at any restaurant!,This chinese restaurant is definitely not for Chinese. Their dish flavors are to suit non Chinese American customers. This is like a sit down No.1 fast food chain restaurant. The service is unprofessional. It's one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have walked in.,The food was great and the atmosphere wonderful.,""Orange chicken was under cooked. Chicken fingers not seasoned and extremely breaded. Pork fried rice cold with raw pieces."

About 10 mins after the ETA passed I checked the web page. My order has been cancelled without notification of any sort. I called to see why, no one had answers, I was told, we'll see what we can do and let you know in 5-10 mins. It's now 1:28pm no call no food.

The toppings on hot dogs could be improved in quantity. Tried the fried chicken hot doogy combo with French fries. French fries were excellent and the dipping sauce was the best pairing with fries. Combo option is pricier for the quantity of fries given,Hotdog was horrible. Taste like just salt and fat .. could not even eat it. Too bad they don't taste the good they serve.,Very yummy burger. Good amount of toppings. Loved the ordering kiosk and the Locker pick up. Green sauce was great. Fries were hot and crispy. Wish it was a little lower in price for a mall food court meal ($13 for the burger alone + $7.50 to add fries and a drink). Would go back again though and try other items!,""The food here is really good. I loved my chili cheese dog and bacon cheese fries. The employees were really nice. The food was served fast, fresh and hot. I will definitely be back."",""It's way too expensive for what it is. Owners are greedy. For a hot dog, a bottle of soda, and a small order of fries, you're looking at around $22-$25 dollars. Be cautious if you order ahead online, their system defaults to adding on a 20% tip for take out. Again, greedy owners, either underpaying their staff and making up for it in tips or hoping people pay more then they have to on an already expensive product. You can find better food for cheaper around, I'd recommend you do that instead of giving Hot Doogy your money."",bro eating etheral fries at hot doogy after coming out of a movie at midnight. so good.,""Really fun atmosphere and amazingly late hours (till 3am or 4am). The burgers and dogs were not my favorite flavor combos, but definitely an experience, and they weren't bad, just not the flavors I would mix (esp the potato chip shredsdidn't like that)."
It was quite pricy. A burger and a dog were $30 something.

It has been a few weeks since the employees changed, they work very slowly. And I have to wait 30-40 minutes every time. Instead of talking non-stop, you need to be quick... Also, conduct a training for your employees to communicate with customers with a smile, not with a frown and a gloomy face. Warning: especially a warning to your red-haired manager, next time I will be strict. That's all."

The food all tasted good but was overpriced for what you receive. The regular order of onion rings came with about four small rings. The hot dogs were a decent size and came with a lot of toppings."
The a very frustrating part of the visit was the registers were not working so we were instructed to use the kiosk. Then the kiosk froze and had to be restarted. It took longer to order my food than to eat it and no one seemed to really care.
The water button on the soda machine kept sticking and wouldn't stop shooting water at me, and I was clearly struggling. All the employees did was stare at me from behind the register that didn't work.

I recently visited The Hot Doggy Place and was extremely disappointed with my experience. I ordered the chicken sandwich, but unfortunately, it was dripping with oil and tasted eerily similar to bacon - a major problem since I'm allergic!
When I politely asked to swap it for a burrito bowl (offering to pay the difference), I was met with attitude from one employee. To make matters worse, another employee took the unwanted sandwich that I took a bite of to her car, ATE IT, and then returned to work!
"All I'm seeking is a refund for the sandwich I couldn't enjoy. Is that too much to ask?"",Os melhores hot dogs que j comi neste pas. O ambiente familiar e o atendimento excelente!

I got the chil cheese dog was so damn tasty plenty off chili cheese and onions and my son made his own bacon sauerkraut mustard it had mad bacon on it and said it was straight fire! The girls working there were hustling working hard and probably can use a nice raise!! All in all would definitely stop in again when we're in town for another show.,We were here this past week and asked about a plant based hot dog option- and they had one! They were very nice in explaining ingredients and range of interesting toppings. A bit pricey but yummy. They should make the plant based options more obvious!,""Very overwhelming smell of cologne, like walking into an Abercrombie and Fitch. The cheeseburger looked good enough but was lacking in flavor, it's unclear how the patty was cooked, I saw staff heating up patties and dogs in the same instant cooker you see at Dunkin. The patty itself seemed to have a fishy odor/taste to it, so I'm not sure if there is some cross contamination going on with their salmon bowl through whatever means they use to """"cook"""" the patty. There are better options for burgers nearby in my opinion (5- guys/smash burger/mooyah/buttons grill). I cannot speak to the other offerings on the menu though as I only had the cheeseburger."
Edit: I appreciate the response as it signifies an engaged and thoughtful owner so first off, thank you. I am not trying to be critical. I am trying to describe my experience and hopefully offer insight from a different point of view.
I will say the establishment was very clean and the staff was friendly and polite.
This is the first restaurant I've been in that has had a diffuser. It was not something I would expect in a restaurant, a home or a clothing store maybe. Personally though a major part of tasting food is the sense of smell. When there is a strong non-food smell competing with the smell of the food I'm eating it detracts from the taste.
I honestly could not explain the 'fishy' smell/taste it was faint but there was an off-taste to the burger that was not something a burger would normally taste like. My best guess was some sort of cross contamination from something else on the menu. This is a guess though not something I directly observed.
I can appreciate that it may be easier/faster to melt the cheese in the instant cookers but if it mixes with whatever other flavors are in there it will take away from the taste of the burger.
"The cheeseburger was not on the kids menu and was not at a kids menu price. In my personal opinion plain and basic offerings on a menu are an indication of their more expensive offerings. When I try a place for the first time I do not immediately start with the most expensive item."",Good,Fui atendido pela Denise ela muito top,Love their Brasilian style hot dogs.

Very reasonably priced. Friendly staff and great food.,""My Dad and I had an absolutely terrible experience at this restaurant. Not only was the manager incredibly rude and unprofessional, but she also refused to allow me to bring in outside food despite my medical condition."
As someone with celiac disease, I have been advised by my doctors not to eat in restaurants due to the risk of cross-contamination. However, when I attempted to explain my situation to the manager, she was completely dismissive and refused to accommodate me in any way.
Until now I've never been to a restaurant who's been anything but welcome to the idea of bringing in food. I simply carry in a plain turkey sandwich made myself, Boar's Head turkey on Schr gluten free bread, 100% gluten free. Normally I ask if they mind, I eat my own food, elsewhere the answer is always, absolutely. Not at Morse Tavern, here it was a big problem, one she could offer no solution.
"I asked the manager to call the owner, requesting if it would be at all possible to allow my normal routine. She called and after a minute came back denying my accommodation request. She said the strict policy was due to Natick having an no outside food law from the local board of health. Wondering if this was true, I called the Natick health department. They said no such town bylaw exists. She also used the excuse """"it could be contaminated""""."
"Next, I asked about gluten free options on the menu. She suggested their salad with salmon. I asked, """"how is it cooked, in a pan or open grill?"""" She replied with an attitude """"I don't understand why have to be so mean to me"""" and stormed off to the kitchen. Clearly her response indicated a complete lack of understanding of the situation. I always ask questions to gauge my confidence in their ability to produce a safe meal. As the grill is contaminated and off limits to celiacs. Every bite I eat must be strictly monitored, no exceptions. As eating even a gram of gluten would result in permanent damage to my digestive system and take up to a month to heal. Why should I take this risk?"
If she can't effectively understand my needs and communicate how can this manager communicate my needs to the kitchen. At that point we decided to leave after a two-minute unnecessarily stress filled visit. After a two-hour drive to get there, this completely ruined my day off from work. My Dad is also disabled and relies on a scooter, it takes ten minutes to get him and the scooter in or out of the car. We had to cancel our lunch with our friend as unfortunately Natick has very limited lunch options. Thus, all that work to get in the door wasted by the manager's lack of thought and inability to listen. We were shocked and disappointed since at any other restaurant they are accommodating.
How dare this restaurant owner and manager dictate what I should eat without having a proper two-way conversation about the allergy precautions and cooking methods used. Especially given I had an ideal 100% safe gluten free lunch sitting in a cooler in the car. Living in a world filled with wheat is hard enough. Social events are stressful for people with celiac disease and made exponentially more difficult with uncooperative and inconsiderate management not willing to adapt.
"It is truly unacceptable for a restaurant to have such a callous attitude towards customers with medical needs. I would strongly advise anyone with dietary restrictions or medical conditions to steer clear of this establishment. The management is completely intolerant and unhelpful, and their disregard for customer health and safety is truly disturbing. Save yourself the trouble and find somewhere else to eat."",Very good service. Delicious food ,""Tuesday night was trivia night, and my two buddies and I had a blast. The meal and service were excellent, and everyone had a fantastic time. The Asian chicken salad and French onion soup were delicious. Terry, our server, was fantastic; she was extremely helpful and friendly. We plan to return and enthusiastically endorse this destination. I highly recommend this place for a fantastic time and tasty food."",Food and service always top notch!,""This restaurant has changed for the the worst ,. The food was always delicious and the servers welcoming, and polite, now it's a different story Tonight I ordered a light dinner, greek salad and sweet potato fires. The fries wert very tasty, well fried. The greek salad was served in a very small plate, and it was difficult to eat it. The server, a man with a beard was the rudest person on earth. I will never dine there again. My main complain is the rude server."",""Good is AMAZING! Their nachos, salads, and pizza are phenomenal."",""It's the only pub in Natick.

Fired rice, wings, beef and chicken teriyaki."",""Ordered $84. worth of food. They replaced a few items in the poo poo platter. A couple of items were missing."
I ordered a side of sweet and sour chicken and didn't get that.
I called when I noticed sweet and sour chicken + they said to me on the phone you have an order that looks like chicken fingers and I said yes which is not what I ordered and he said that is our sweet and sour chicken.
I told them that's much different from the sweet and sour chicken I got before.
"But I took that word for it. I ate a chicken finger from the poo poo platter and then I tried one of""""sweet and sour"""" chickens and they were the exact same."
In a small order of beef teriyaki came with 2.
All of that money wasted. I would've gladly paid for what I actually got.
The stuff they actually got right was ok at best.
I've been there before and never had to much of a problem, but then again I was only ordering a couple of things.
"Never going back that's for sure!"",""Good food but so disappointed by portion sizes. I know the new world of inflation is tough but this was truly disappointing. Moo Sho pork large order was nothing like the past, spare ribs were tiny, beef teriyaki much smaller then the past. Food is tasty but a big disappointment with portion size."",""First and last time that I order here."
"It was a weird bug in the food. Gross "",""The worst part is the food. It's honestly not that good. It's edible, but not super flavourful. However, there are many good parts that make up for it. Firstly, it's open later than any other restaurant in the area. While there are some fast food restaurants open at the same time nearby, those mostly are only open through the drive-through, unlike Dragon Chef, which is open in the restaurant itself. I have ended many a drunken escapade here. The atmosphere is nice, it has a cool hole in the wall feel.

Fried rice was a bit soggy but ok,""Good place for inexpensive, quick, easy, decent takeout."",""Solid late-night americanized chinese food in Waltham. Open the latest on weekends of any area non-fast food joints. I order from here monthly and the delivery is always fast, or sometimes I get pickup within 10-15 minutes of ordering. Accurate read-back of order by phone. Competitive pricing, staff are busy with loads of orders but always happy to lend a hand. I recommend the donuts when available, like sugary chinese fried dough pieces. Crab rangoons are by far the tastiest in the area in my opinion with the perfect mix of cream cheese and imitation crabmeat."",""I am writing this AS I am eating from them for the first time."
They are an an absolute disgrace.
Never order from these people. Even the drunk people around me are complaining.
First, they are the first Chinese restaurant that gives NO rice. Doesn't tell you. I would have ordered it if I knew.
Second. Every single dish of the four I ordered was dissapointing garbage. The f'ed up both general gou/tso chicken AND lo mein. How do you f up noodles?! They did it. They don't even look right, much less taste right.
Imagine someone made lo mein using cheap spaghetti. I'm positive that is what is happening here.
I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce. There were 5 shrimp swimming in a quart of sauce. That I have no rice to pour it over.
In this place, there is neither a chef, nor a dragon. Only frauds.
Never eat here. Never order from here. You have been told, and warned.
These frauds sell garbage that they pretend is food. Don't fall for it!
There is a non zero chance that this place is a front for drugs and sells bad food on purpose so people won't bother thier money laundering operation.
Their food looks like diarrhea in the BEFORE pic.
"And I am afraid what an hour from now will feel and look like."",""Received some solid food poisoning from here yesterday. Chicken chow foon, boneless spareribs, and chicken fried rice. Sick for 6-8hrs yesterday...yikes"",The food was not terrible but the pork fried rice legitimately has no meat or pork whatsoever. They filled all three sections with rice and a lousy piece of spare rib. Completely unsatisfied this business should be ashamed of themselves for robbing their customers gave us two pieces of tiny squares what the call napkins for two entire meals. It was tissue paper and these tiny cups of sauce and not even having the decency to fill it. They are cheap do not waste your money here. When I told the restaurant about the issue they did not seem to even care.,""My favorite is singapore rice noodles & boneless ribs but the prices have increased incrementally over the last year. It used to be $17.34 for my order, june 2020, and in December 2021, it's now $21.33. Proportions of meat and noodles seem to have changed a bit and quality of cuts of boneless spare ribs is lower. Still pretty good!"

On the next visit, the guy behind the counter wasn't there. I mentioned the dumplings incident and asked for a large egg roll for the price of a small as a courtesy. Denied.
Disappointed? Absolutely. Just as well, every time I've ordered egg rolls here they've been cold. Thought this time might be different.
Not that they don't believe me, they said, but I had no proof. They sure don't want to get beat for an egg roll, you know. Do they have a lot of 64 year old guys telling elaborate lies to get an extra egg roll?

The manager was able to resolve the issue within a day and refund the difference to both of us. However, although I appreciate that he resolved this issue, and that we are human (as this was his excuse) it makes me wonder how someone could look at a $35 bill and add a $37 tip (which is what happened).

I'm here all the time,""Very nice cute place, the good portions on the food and service was great. There is no easy parking around other than that great."",Great place for dinner and date nights. Love the atmosphere and service.,Love this place. I just wish they would add and impossible/beyond burger option and I would be here once a week.,""The food was well prepared and tasteful. The service was excellent. The management was very accommodating. All in all, a wonderful afternoon."",""My mom grew up in West Roxbury, so my husband and I flew to Boston from CA to tour the area a few years ago. Came across this little place and they served the BEST MACARONI & CHEESE I've ever had! I want to visit again-I'll be heading straight to Porters from the airport."",Everything I have eaten here is so good. My favorite is the bolognese. Most items are seasonal which is a plus cuz it's always fresh. I think they have the best burger I've had. Highly recommend for the food. This place is in my top 5. The waitstaff however are not the friendliest and not the worst but the food makes up for it.,Can't get a friendlier service. Plus a great draft selection. If you come earlier than 9pm the food is super.,Cute little place. Small on the inside; maybe like 10-12 seats at the bar and 8 tables close next to each other. Salmon and fish tacos were excellent and drinks were great too!,Great spot - cozy with a solid menu and amazing service. Wished the opened at 1 but if that's the only bad thing to say it says a lot.,""Friendly staff, food smelled amazing!!"",""Stumbled onto this long standing establishment while exploring' West Rox. Could not have been more satisfied! Had a couple of apps (cauliflower and house made chips ) that were delish. All food coming out from the kitchen looked hella good and will drive my return. However, the star of my impromptu visit was Dave the bartender and the FANTASTIC whiskey based cocktails he made! Please visit if you are in the area!!"",""i don't live in the area, but whenever i am i always make sure to stop in here! great food and great beverages!"",Great drinks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"Ray's New Garden,12:00PM - 11:00PM,Upscale modern bar with asian styling,Chinese and japanese food,$15-25,Small business,Sit down,The service is wonderful. They are attentive to detail and quick when you ask for something. The food is good and comes out quick. The sushi is top notch. They are the perfect size and proper for a bite. Grab Rangoon are fresh and some of the best I've had. Could use a cosmetic refresh but overall great place!,The last few orders I had some chicken fingers and some were really hot and some cold...the chicken fingers were like chewy and seemed old...the fries were great!,""Great place for ANY occasion! The owner Ray is pretty awesome, always makes an appearance when I go there for Karaoke nights (check out DJ Demetri, Thursday nights). He is very generous too, and friendly to the regular customers. The food.... IS AMAZING! I would come here over any other similar venue that would be closer to my home, just for the food."",The food was absolutely delicious!,""Atmosphere, Amanda behind the bar was extremely friendly and personable. Atmosphere was modern and nice. The food. I'm pretty confident in my pallette when it comes to food, especially Chinese food. Their hot and sour soup was amazing. Old school flavors, wood ear mushrooms, golden needles, tofu among other delicious fillers. Not only did it have perfect flavoring but it was traditionally garnished with sesame oil. It also had a good amount of heat. This soup should clear your sinuses while maintaining a strong flavor foundation, this totally does. Another highlight is the chicken wings. Most places have down the crispy and the juicy part. These also had a nice full flavor. Probably a five spind blend. It also kept the flavor when reheated. The egg rolls are made on location and pass the can you eat them without duck sauce test. Also delicious! The beef teriyaki was a red marinade but had more of the traditional flavoring. Very tender, and flavorful. Highly recommend! I thought the chicken fingers, boneless ribs, and crab rangoons were solid. Crab rangoons had a little sweetness. My only complaint, I liked the lobster sauce, but it was extra salty. I was able to use a duck sauce and some hot mustard to cut the salt."
"Ray's New Garden in Needham overall gets my initial stamp of approval on places that should be checked out. If you're a fan of hot and sour soup this could transport you back to one of your first times having it. I will definitely get back!"",""Do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding this place. Came here for Friday night dinner with the family, left in less than 20 min. Seems like the restaurant only pays attention to the bar area because the rest is pretty empty with no decor, no music, pretty depressing. I immediately wanted to leave but we thought we would give the food a try. Even more disappointed. Everything we ordered was tasteless, dry and overall bad that we had to send some back! The sushi chef has no idea what he is doing so might as well order sushi from the grocery store. It's too bad because we live nearby and wanted to find another asian restaurant besides bamboo. The only good thing was the waitress had a pleasant attitude."",No flavor at all,""If you're considering sushi at Ray's New Garden, keep looking. The rolls are tiny and fall apart easily. You're better off getting your sushi at Market Basketit's closer to the real deal"",""Waaay too expensive for the portion sizes, however very tasty."",Great food and atmosphere,Egg rolls are very very good here.,""Service was hectic but for having a group of nearly 50 ppl, they did a great job. The food was also decent. It could have been a little more organized but they looked understaffed so its understandable. Overall decent experience."",""My friends and I went to this restaurant for many years and always tipped 20%. We realized one day that the check was higher than it was supposed to be and the owner informed us that they automatically add 20% gratuity to the total. This wasn't indicated anywhere on the receipt, so for years we had been paying 40%+ in tips. Check your totals peolple. Unacceptable."",""Great bar, food, atmosphere, crowd. Hidden jem."",Value for meals is fair. Sushi and select drinks are their strong point. Fried appetizers such as rangoons are hit or miss. Usually retaining old already fried in oil. Service even at sparse hours can be finicky. Specials are solid however and the particular deals on certain days are worth it. On par for a fusion place in these parts.,Modern and spacious. Food was great.,Amanda is the best bartender ,""Gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised by this place!"
This place has the best crab rangoons I've had in years! They don't spare the filling! My only regret is that I didn't order MORE!
They don't spare the filling, it's texture is good and the evidence of the ingredients is unmistakable. Not just the cream cheese! You have to try them! If you want sweet and sour sauce you need to request it, some places serve duck sauce with them.
The restaurant itself is nice. They have a bar area that seems popular and has a decent size crowd. The whole place is well maintained, plenty of parand clean.
I also ordered beef teriyaki and eggplant with oyster sauce. Everything was delicious. I was not into the eggplant dish, but it was the first time I tried it. I know it was good, done right, but it just wasn't what my taste buds wanted.
The staff was friendly and very helpful. Customers were also very friendly and that helps to let you know what the customer base is like.
I have been in a lot of Chinese restaurants in my travels, rays is at the top of my list.
"I will be eating there again!"",Friday night is karaoke pretty good singers and the DJ is pretty cool. The food is beyond freshm,""Went for lunch special. Like almost 20 choices and I think all were under $15 with choice of soup. Good lunch special! Have not been here for lunch ever but always has been good old school chinese food for dinner. If in the area for lunch as Arnold said """"I'll be back"""""",Great hidden gem sports bar! The $6 sushi special on Thursdays is fine should you need to save $on sushi. Be advised: Fish is customarily delivered to restaurants fresh on Fridays,""It was late at night and I wanted to eat so badly. Most of the restaurants were closed, but we found this hidden gem. I asked the crab Rangoon appetizer, the Ray's burger, and the fried rice with pork. The food was delicious, but the crab Rangoon was the best of the best. To drink, I asked a Virgin pia colada, and it was ok. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very good. The waiter is kind and patient."",""Very cool atmosphere, music for you, good food, polite and respectful service, I recommend it!"",""# 1 food is great,,,, service is right on,,,,, very friendly atmosphere, highly recommend"",""This restaurant is hiding on a small street off of Chestnut in Needham, lovely place, big space, delicious Chinese and Japanese dishes. I had the moo shi , and my kids got the sushi, everyone was happy with their selection."",""Ray's is a modern update on the classic American Chinese restaurant which also offers a sushi menu. The Mai Tai are 110, and the dishes are served hot with the perfect amount of saltiness. If you're in the Needham area and craving Chinese food with excellent service, Ray's is definitely worth a visit."",Classic Chinese-American joint. Don't miss the Mai-Tai!,very quick service. food was excellent. fair price.,""Wish I could post pictures!!!"
"Terrible!"",""DO NOT EVER PLACE AN ORDER OVER THE PHONE AND EXPECT TO PAY WHAT YOU SEE ONLINE. I am appalled at this restaurants customer service and operations. They charged $40+ dollars for an order that should have costed $26. They weren't willing to work with the person at first and that the customer was wrong in the first place cause they were looking at the wrong prices. There are only one set of prices to go off of so how can the customer be wrong? I just had to witness an issue where the receptionist could only say """"sorry i cant do anything"""" about a refund and gave a web address to make online orders, and that doesnt even work! And when the owner came, he said """"i cant do nothing about it"""". He being the owner couldn't do anything about updating their online prices or provide a reason as to why they were overcharging this customer or provide a refund. It was a struggle trying to get a refund for their overpriced food. I haven't had their food but if their service was anything like this situation then it's probably not even worth trying. Maybe after this review they will consider updating their website to reflect actual prices and not misleading a hungry customer. If I could give a score less than 1 I would."",""We visited this restaurant yesterday"
(6/26)and overall it was not a good experience.
Food - not so good. Very bland & cold.
Atmosphere - Nice looking restaurant in appearance.
"Service - AWFUL! We walked in and the lady who greeted was friendly enough. However, we get to the table and it was not clean. We sat down and waited 15 minutes just to order drinks. The waitress was terrible! Such a bad attitude and not friendly at all. She should not be in the hospitality industry. We also witnessed two other tables the were having a negative experiences with the waitress as well. We will not recommend this restaurant nor will we ever return."",""Got the chicken lo mein, had absolutely no taste and was completely drenched in oil and grease. Chicken also had no flavor and was chewy and overcooked. They pack the container with pasta and chicken but i barley even ate any. Wouldn't recommend this place, from the reviews id say its like roulette its either very good or very bad."",""I came for dinner here last night for the first time just after 6 the place was not busy. Honestly the food was good if a little pricy. However the customer service here they NEED to improve. Our waitress was straight up not nice and was acting like she was just really annoyed to be takeing our orders and dealing with us. It was like it was bothering her for us to be there. We tried to be really nice to her because maby she was just haveing a really bad day but that dident even get us so much as a thank you or a smile. Overall not a good experience and will not be comeing back."
"This next bit is for the owner: I have worked in customer service my whole life. I am telling you this was not right and did not meet any standard of service."",Great eats for all!!,""Muy sabrosa la comida, exquisita"",""A hidden gem in Needham - this place is worth driving to. Many restaurants have excellent food, but what makes Ray's so special is Christina, one of the owners. I tend to do take-out and like to order things a certain way and Christina will make sure that it comes out exactly the way I ordered it. She is pleasant, happy and passionate about making every experience at Ray's a memorable one. Plus, it's a wonderful place to bring children."",Worse Chinese I had for a while. The house fried rice was tasteless as was the chicken with vegetables. Food was very oily and the oil that was used for some of the meat tasted rancid. I provided my feedback and was assured that the owner will get back to me but obviously not interested in my feedback and did not call back. Very disappointing experience,Best chinese food in the area!,We had a nice time even though there was snow outside. We had two drinks plus a pu pu platter for two,""Stopped in for a quick lunch! Was immediately greeted by Amanda the bartender. Very friendly and efficient at her position! Made you feel very welcome! I had a lunch combo plate. Rice, Chicken Fingers, Boneless Ribs and Crab Rangoon. As always very fresh and delicious. Will definitely be back for Sushi Thursdays"",""My husband loves the grab Rangoon, so we drive all the way from Rhode Island just to get some definitely five stars on that aspect. but the Rice and noodles are more on the overcooked side every time we order, but for the most part, the food is decent never dined in always take out so couldn't tell you much about the environment ."",Great food. Fair prices. Professional staff.,""went here and sat unserved for 45 minutes. when asked for a menu, they misgendered my friend and we left. no idea what the food is like, didn't even get a drink."",This was the second time we had a social at Ray's New Garden.

Food good otherwise when done correctly!,""Saturday night they have karaoke, 10 televisions in the main dining room for your sports pleasure, great service by a friendly Filipina server named Angelica; my wife enjoyed a scorpion bowl and I had my usual house margarita; we ate BBQ ribs and two different types of maki rolls (Red Sox and Scorpion). The food was tasty, good sized servings, and nice presentation. Already recommended to our friends."",It's been most of my time in the bar. Food was okay sort of tasted typical. Drinks were same way. Bathrooms very clean,""I like trying new food, but this food was noy good. Too much grease and not enough flavour."",""Generally moderate environment, but nothing particularly incredible. They had a side room that was big enough for our large (20 ppl) group, which was nice. Decent for late-night drinks as they are open late. Lots of fried food and slightly mediocre asian-inspired dishes."",Friendly neighborhood bar. Avoid karaoke at all costs. Good to watch a game.,Amazing crab Rangoon s and very nice staff. Thank you for a great night.,""Some of the worst sushi and beef w. Broccoli I have ever had. Sushi was tiny, falling apart with barely any ingredients inside. Beef with broccoli was virtually flavorless. Terrible that Ray's has fallen this far. If you want tiny scraps for sushi and flavorless food, you'll love this place."",The best Chinese food in the area!,""Maybe, maybe if I was too drunk to stand would this food be any good. Unfortunately I'm stone cold sober and my taste buds are screaming with remorse. Eat anywhere else."",Food was terrible even for Chinese food and insanely expensive. Low quality ingredients and the food was obviously cooked in a rush even though we were the only people getting food at 5pm. The noodles were soggy and the vegetables chewy. The beef teriyaki was deep fried for some reason? Glasses were filthy and the whole place was in need of a deep cleaning. Staff were attentive and friendly but that was the only redeeming quality.

The salad was amazing with fresh, crisp ingredients and the steak tips were so good! They were packed with flavor, tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.

The atmosphere is always lively, but not so loud that you can't actually hear the person next to you (which is a big win in my book)."

We were quite hopeful about this fab new addition to Needham!
The female bartender had an attitude from the beginning, brought an obviously very flat beer, and had to be replaced.
We requested a side of brussel sprouts for $6, with no cheese or bacon, they showed up with the appetizer size for $12. When we requested the accurate order, they still charged us for both at the $12 price. Didn't bring any silverware to eat them with for 10 minutes..so we picked.
Bar and floor space were dirty, and the bill added another cocktail we never had. If they had taken a moment to apologize for the error, or comp one of the brussels we would have left with a much better experience....instead, we'll never go back again!
"Such a shame~"",""I had an excellent dining experience at the bar. The service was outstandingthe bartenders were friendly, attentive, and on point the entire time.

It seemed like many of the people who popped in were regulars, which added to the welcoming and friendly environment of the pub! I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was heavenly, I will definitely be coming back for it again! "",""I recently discovered The Dooliner, and it's an absolute gem! The cozy atmosphere, adorned with authentic Irish decor, immediately makes you feel at home. The staff is incredibly friendly, always ready with a warm welcome and great beers on tap (including Smithwicks). You can't go wrong with their fish and chips or the short rib poutine special. Cannot recommend this place enough!"",""Very cozy little pub with great atmosphere, food, and drinks! Shout out to the bartender Julie for the warm welcome."",Been searching high and low for years; these are the best wings in the Boston area.,A great pub with friendly staff and fantastic food!,Try the grilled cheese and onion sandwich with ceasar side salad! A tasty irish treat ,""Made the trip to The Dooliner yesterday! Greeted by Alan the bartender, from Donegal, we hit it off and had a great time! The Guinness is nice and creamy, one of the more authentic pours I have had outside of Ireland! Food was cracking, hot honey wings and Irish curry fries! Will definitely be making the 45 minute trip back soon!!"",Excellent Beef Stew and The Lamb Shank is amazing. Great atmosphere and great service.,""The burger of the Dooliner is hands-down, the most succulent and well composed burger that we have ever encountered within a 20 mile radius. It's not a smash burger. It's a proper pub burger cooked to perfection with bacon made of the crispiest swine, cheddar so smooth and don't even get me started on the bun, fluffy tender, yet with the integrity to hold the juices of the most glorious burger to grace our presence both here and now and ions into the future."",""My espresso martini was good, but that's where the good stuff ends. My husband and I ordered a medium burger each and we both were served well-done, burnt burgers to the point that the charred meat was just falling off itself because it was so overcooked. For $17? Just oof."",Stopped off here on my way to the airport and I am very glad that I did. The Irish Curry with Chips was very flavorful.,""Had the Irish stew and it was so good!

Clean, cozy atmosphere, authentic but unassuming. Our lovely waitress was attentive and informative, giving us great recommendations from the menu. The shepherds pie was so so tasty with large chunks of tender lamb, and the fish and chips were hot, salty, delicious!! The wings were also some of the best we've ever had!"",""Yummy corned beef hash (they make their own) with scrambled eggs for Saturday brunch. Soccer on the TV, music on the speakers, sunlight through the windows, what else do you need?"",""What a wonderful place! The food was hearty and super delicious, service was on spot!"

Definitely a place you should check out if you're in the neighborhood."",""Nice, friendly bartender/waitress/hostess. Good portions of piping hot , great tasting wings, calamari, and Shepherds pie made with real Lamb. The drinks were smooth, Pina margarita and lemon martini."",""Don't normally post, but I want this place to succeed, so starting from the top:"
1. Fries are amazing
2. Good prices
3. Service was great - great server
4. Chicken tenders - not traditional, but quite hot, and very good
5. Great atmosphere, we sat outside on the patio and it was lovely
6. Mussels, very good (need a good dipping bread, ala focaccia - see last point)
7. Shepherd's Pie - Delicious, but not traditional - very tender meat, not much in the way of gravy, nice presentation with scallions
8. Burger was OK - ordered medium, outside was burned, and inside was raw/rare - still edible - meat was good, if they cook it differently.
9. Fish - OK - with such a limited menu, you have to knock fish and chips/fried fish out of the park, and this was okay, but not the best. Limit the seasoning - focus on crispy outside and juicy inside.
10. Bread - not good - A glorified version of Wonderbread left nothing to dip in the mussels, and not edible on the fish sandwich.
"Overall - good experience - this place has great potential if they can sure up a few items, and we would definitely come back for drinks and apps, but probably not seek them out for dinner until they can refocus a couple dishes. Cheers!"",""So friendly, such good food. Open consistently. Clean, bright. Just the best!"",""How does one go from Wow to what the heck, in such a short time?"
Was in a couple of weeks ago, the FOOD WAS FABULOUS!
Came around again last Saturday with a guest.
Not a soul in the place.. I thought great!!! WRONG!
"Bartender couldn't make a margarita. Calamari was undercooked and bland, fish and chips was as well except the fries were burnt! Do better!"",""A very authentic Irish pub in an unassuming corner of a Boston suburb. Good range of Irish and other beers, popular with both Bostonians and Irish. A couple of screens to show sports."",DYNAMITE Steak tips,""I don't usually find myself dining at pubs, but Dooliner Irish Pub made me question all my life choices. After passing it several times on my way home, I decided to make a plan to return for dinner. Nestled in an unassuming corner of Newton, this gem is like finding a four-leaf clover (plus, it offers plenty of parking)."
As for the food - I went for the fish and chips because, well, why mess with a classic? My buddy opted for the shepherd's pie, and we both dove into their wide and diverse beer selection like kids in a candy store.
We snagged a spot on the covered back patio, which is like the VIP section for people who like fresh air with their ale. Despite it being a bustling Thursday evening, the service was top-notch. Good service is becoming incredibly rare find in the Greater Boston area, so I really appreciated the Dooliner friendly and attentive staff.
"The food, drinks and the vibe were so nice that I've already made a return trip and have been recommending the pub to all my Watertown/Waltham/Newton friends. If you're in the area and looking for a place that combines good food, great beer, and stellar service, Dooliner Irish Pub is your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow! Even if you're not in the area - it's definitely worth the drive."",""Was outside waiting for someone. Looks good from the outside."
"*got pop up asking how it was*"",""First time in to the Dooliner at the weekend. Very friendly staff, great atmosphere and the all of food was lovely! Looking forward to coming back soon!"",""Went to The Dooliner tonight for the first time. It was not crowded (it should be!) so it was easy to get a seat. The waitress was great, very attentive, smiled and had a lovely brogue. There were 3 of us and we all had something different. The Shepherd's Pie was made with chunks of meat, not ground beef. The fish and chips was plentiful and crispy. The steak tips were cooked medium rare to perfection. The menu is small but has something to offer anyone. We each had a drink and the bill was just shy of $100.00. Pretty good deal for some really good food. Go here...tell your friends to go here...you won't be disappointed!"",Food wasn't awful but the Shepards pie came straight out of a tv dinner box the beef was dry and didn't taste very good. Caesar salad was ok.

If you haven't been to the dooliner you are missing out!,""The baked haddock special was amazing, and the Cornee Beef Reuben sandwich was also so good! Great atmosphere!"",""What a great pub!! With an atmosphere that takes me back to the west coast of Ireland, The Dooliner would certainly fit in alongside the likes of McDermott's and Gus O' Connors. The food was delicious and had sizable portions. I had a great no-frills burger that hit the spot, with chargrilled edges but perfectly medium on the inside. I sampled the shepherd's pie and the Fish and Chips which I will have to get next time. The mussels and calamari are solid starters. I look forward to returning often to The Dooliner. Congrats on moving to the neighborhood."",""I absolutely adore this place! Its atmosphere transports me straight to an Ireland bar it's like a little slice Ireland. This Bar/restaurant truly captures the essence of Irish cuisine and ambiance. I indulged in their fish and chips, and it was simply delightful.

Great staff! Welcome to the neighborhood!,My son and I found our new favorite burger spot today. So good!,Awesome place,""I had a great time. It felt like being back in Ireland. There was a live Irish band and service was great. The Reuben sandwich was delicious and the fish in the fish sandwich was so soft and flaky."
"The bar area was busy since it was St Paddy's day weekend, but we were still able to get seated. The outdoor patio is a highlight and will be especially lovely in the summer!"",Love this place!

The food was delicious - roasties and Yorkie pud were perfect, fish and chips were excellent. Service was top notch, and atmosphere was relaxed. Really enjoyed it there, and will definitely be back with friends. Maybe also consider opening up in Arlington too?!"",""What a lovely evening! We were in town to bring our son back to school and found this wonderful place online. We recently went to London and this place has all the charm and class of a real pub. ( I realize they are Irish and not English ), but there is nothing like a real neighborhood pub. I wish we had more of them in America; especially where we live in Maine. I dream of opening one someday. The owners should be very proud of this establishment. Friendly service, excellent food and delicious drinks. A pub such as this is like a giant hug and these people have done it. Real deal."
The ingredients were quality- my pan seared salmon was fresh and perfectly cooked. I ordered it over the arugula salad which was perfectly dressed with a light house-made vinaigrette. My husband ordered a delicious, rich, flavorful mushroom bisque and the s&p wings. Both waitresses who served us were lovely.
"It is small and a bit loud but in the best way - bustling with happy diners. I loved it and cannot wait to come back when we are in town again."",""The two female bartenders who worked last night were not only super rude, but also proceeded to talk about customers negatively openly behind the bar."",Amazing Fish & Chips,""Great fun. For a suburb, a happening place."",""Excellent drinks, food, and service in an intimate Irish pub setting. Thank you!"",Great pub and great people. An awesome place for a meal or just a drink.,Best pub in Needham and the surrounding areas!,This place is just amazing. Make sure to get the Vegas ! It's spicy and awesome ,""Sal con sal. Inmensas cantidades de sal. Y despus el manager que no nos dio una mesa de las varias que haba libres pues estaban reservadas, y cuando terminamos de comer en la barras las mismas mesas seguan libres. Le preguntamos y se encogi de hombros."
"Es un sitio de moda, pero realmente no entiendo el motivo. Mal servicio, comida salada exageradamente y manager sin formacin."",""The James has a great vibe, and I've wanted to like it, but it is unfortunately spoiled by mediocre food and ambivalent service. My burger tasted like it came out of a Sodexo catalog; my daughter's pricey steak frites was slightly better. The draft list is limited and heavy on IPAs. I wouldn't have minded so much but the service made me wonder if I'd insulted someone somehow. The host ignored us and was then unapologetic. After 10 minutes at the table one server took our drink orders. Another took our food order and then disappeared for roughly 40 minutes. After the food arrived mine sat for 25 minutes while I waited for a server to check in so I could order another beer. Eventually she reappeared. We did not see her again, however, and after finishing my lukewarm burger it took another twenty minutes before the first server offered to bring the check."
"I don't appreciate being ignored, and at these prices I don't expect to have to flag down servers. Perhaps it could be forgiven if the food were executed better, but between the prices, the food, and the service there's a sad waste of an attractive restaurant here."",Such a great local spot. The food and drinks are excellent. Friendly staff and love the live music.,""If the perfect burger exists, I just had it!"",""Just beer but great bartenders, very knowledgeable."",""Excessively loud noise level (99-105 decibel) made for painful and unpleasant experience, could not hear person sitting next to me, had to leave and take food out, find a place to sit and eat, resulting in cold soggy food.

"But it can get pretty noisy depending on what time you're there."",""Very good food. The best I ever ate. I definitely come back again. It takes long to wait, but worth it."",""You would never expect this to be such a cool restaurant from the outside, it is sort of hidden in a parking lot behind some other building. But once you walk in the door you will love the charm and warmth. Everything about dinner was perfect. We had mussels, burgers, fish & chips, short rib pie and they the bread pudding desert. The service was outstanding. Cannot beat a good waitress who brings a great attitude and had awesome recommendations."
"We will be back soon!"",It's a pub.,""Received a gift card and we were pleasantly surprised. Great atmosphere, drink and food and fine live music. We'll be going again!"",""The Sunday roast is amazing. I get the sirloin. One of the best meals, I have ever had. The fish and chips is perfect. The bread pudding is so good, and enough for two. The burger is done right, and the fries are awesome. They have something called peri peri shrimp. It's very unique and i think it's seasonal, and if it's on the menu, get it."
"The bartenders make great signature drinks, and a great pour on the Guinness. I couldn't recommend this place more."",""This was my first time to The James, and it sure lived up to my expectations! I arrived with my coworkers and was promptly greeted and seated at a quaint corner table. We started our meal with the black garlic hummus which was creamy and rich with a pleasant hint of citrus. The grilled naan was fresh and tender making the perfect combination with the hummus. For our entrees, my coworker chose the pan seared salmon, short rib and ale pie and the Statler chicken breast while I enjoyed the za'atar spiced cauliflower steak. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. I loved the flavors in the cauliflower steak and roasted cauliflower risotto especially the tempura crisps and cippolini jam! Those components added a nice texture and slight sweetness that was welcomed with such a hearty dish. My coworkers loved their dishes and my one coworker finish the entire short rib and ale pie. We couldn't finish our evening off without dessert so we decided to try both options available that evening. The chocolate ganache was rich and decadent but the start of the show was the toffee bread pudding. It was sublime and absolutely hit the spot!!! What a delight this meal was!! I will definitely be back!"",""We brought friends to The James who had never been and they were blown away!!our cocktails were great, the black garlic hummus and mussels were as well. The burgers and fries never disappoint. We were lucky to be there in time to catch the great live music too. Shout out to Mary Keily and Saige G.

Hard to talk while the band is playing, but great experience."",""Got a last minute reservation by calling, same day. Friendly staff, great service, great food, cozy."",Unique and flavorful Shaved Fennel & Celeriac Salad better than expected.,""I got eclectic vibes with unique take on food and drink, pickled vetables as an appetizer!! I have not seen that in years. Very good, by the way. I am a non drinker, and i got a Clausthaler, a non-alcoholic beer that was smoth and delicious. It was the best non-alcoholic I have had. Lucas and Shawn are fantastic behind the bar. Enjoy your experience. You WILL be happy."",It's solid go to with great crowds and service. The seasonal drinks that they rotate are top notch. If they have the pork chop on the menu when you're there is a great choice. It can be loud but that's fine for most including me.,""Truly, a very lovely restaurant."",""If you've already had a great night and don't think it can get any better, stop by on your way home. The whole vibe is absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended."",Super cool place. Was a wait but worth it. Good beers and food!,""Simply Outstanding."
Thank You for accommodating Us on a busy Friday Evening.
Just Lovely.
Start to Finish.
"Thank Y'all."",""Best burger I've had in a awhile, and nice single malt list!"",Cocount rice in the peri peri shrimp was very burned,""This is elevated irish food, with a more elegant vibe, but still cozy and friendly like a favorite pub. It is a small menu of excellent quality, (short rib & ale pie, PEI mussels are our faves) and the drink menu is well-populated. We like the interior, but in summer, grab a table outside on their lovely patio. Often there has been musicians on the patio to make for a super date night out, or a place to meet friends."",Definitely an Irish pub,""Excellent food, good beer and drinks."",""4 stars only because a lot of the stuff we went there expecting was not available on the menu and in the end - while the meal itself was satisfying- we came away with a bit of regret about what it could have been if the stuff we went expecting based on what we saw on the menu had actually been there. It was not."
Everything we had however felt like there was genuine thought put into how the plate was organised and the interplay of flavours and textures was carefully balanced.
Shrimp starter was great and the short rib pie too.
The old world style chocolate ganache was deeply satisfying - even when it was simple and straightforward
"All said - I would definitely want to go back given that it's in the locality but knowing with certainty on what's on the menu that day - would help me make up my mind."",Great spot,Good place. Small bar in the train station area. Great drinks and service.,Not too much to choose from. But it was good. 1st time there came highly recommended to my friend but wasn't what he expected. Other reviews I saw here had Fish & chips chicken wings I'm confused I didn't see them on my 1 page menu. Only around 20 items to choose from? Apps dinner sides???,""Two regrets: 1, waiting so long to dine here and 2, not bringing more people with us to sample more of the food."
"Very cool spot, indoors and out, with friendly staff and fantastic food. The pan roasted chicken could not have been better seasoned and cooked...incredibly tender and juicy and full of flavor. The burger and fries were terrific and the soda bread was """"the best I've had"""" (per my date)."

Was a pretty okay breakfast. Nothing overly special but a good standard American breakfast place. The hash was the best part. The pictures on the menu looked better than the actual food. The omelette was put together rather messily, but taste was pretty standard for what it is. The egg, cheese and bacon taco were good enough for the price.

She kept trying to push us to order food and kept saying next, next if we didn't respond within 0.5 seconds of finishing ordering.

Also, most of their drinks have free refills."",""Best fun place ever to eat at ,for over 50 years !"",Great brunch experience. Nice servers with beautiful smile and welcoming atmosphere.,""They are open 24/7, that hits "",Always a good vibe they treat you like family.,""Food was excellent, service is impeccable. Sure I got my order wrong but they made up for it big time."
"I recommend this place highly."",""Absolutely disappointed, It took me half an hour to get a fork and knife to eat my breakfast"",""The turkey sandwich was good, the onion rings were great with the dipping sauce. The service was ok, slow at first but better after I ordered. After i finished my meal, she brought my check $19.24. I put out $25 needing $$ for her tip. She asked if I needed change and i said yes-perhaps she didn't hear me, I waited about 10 minutes but I never saw her again. Not real happy about a $6 tip on a $19 meal."
"I appreciate that the helper woman wanted to stay busy, swept the floors, washed the glass front doors...but then chose to mop the tile floors all through the restaurant with pine cleaner at 3pm. I'm allergic to pine so I began sneezing. Then I walked very carefully on the wet tile to the restroom and out of the building. Unless there's a spill i would think wet-mopping floors should be done when fewer people are eating. I'm 73 and falling on wet tile would not make my day."",La comida es muy buena,""Horrible. Could be that I am ordering breakfast at 4 am and the cook is halfway sleeping still. Could be they could care less. When picking up, food is almost always cold and seemingly rushed. It sucks because some of the new menu items could be a lot more attractive than they currently are."",You could do both.,""It's our monthly twice to dine in place. May be the management changed or something happened to this restaurant. My coffee cup was not washed, It has someone red pinkish lipstick mark on the cup. The food was stale and was cold when it arrived. Very disappointed with the service this time. This happened on Sept 8 around 2 pm after."",""As a Turk, I found the food delicious and the service speed was a bit slow but the place was nice because of the crowd."",""My Grandfather and I go here often. Delicious scrambled eggs, solid hash-browns, and mouthwatering pancakes. Staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. Always offering to refill your drink. Lovely time, and food is very reasonable. Strongly recommended!"",Food was cold and very inedible servicer was to busy talking to friends place is awful,So I wanted a burger but I guess there was no meat left which was probably a blessing in discise the food doesn't seem the freshest the soda was super syrupy.. the eggs were still slimey ya know not cooked all.the way and the french toast took literally 30minutes to make and when I got it was literally 1.piece but that was the best part of the meal.. the o ly OK thing is that it's the only place open at 4am.i was starving.. I was scared I was gonna get sick but so far so.good. I did choose that over the McDonald's that was open next door tho and would again..,Very fresh and hot waffles and pancakes,They are extremely slow,Food was good and the service was great. The restroom has a really funky smell.,One of the worst experiences I've ever had a IHOP. It all starts with the employees. Never had this problem before at a IHOP. Hopefully it won't happen again,I ordered pancakes for my son they only gave him one packet of syrup and no utensils.,""Where to begin, First of all, the Host was rude, Didn't want to let us choose our table."
Once we did sit down, the AC wasn't working on one side of the building.
The atmosphere was weird. They had co workers flirting with each other a couple tables down. The bathrooms were filthy and full of stains and water on the floor. At leats I hope that it was water.
One of the servers that was helping out our main server while handing the food out, LICKED his finger after serving us the food. Absolutely disgusting and disrespectful to us, the family trying to enjoy a nice breakfast in the afternoon.
Once we finally did get our food, and I say finally because we waited nearly 40 minutes for breakfast style foods. Some of it was extremely overcooked and other stuff like eggs were very undercooked almost raw.
"If you want just the ihop taste, you can go here. Either wise if you care about service, Atmosphere, and an overall quality product coming from their kitchen. I would not recommend this place."",""The air conditioner isn't consistent in the restaurant providing pockets of cold. The tables need some repairs too. Otherwise the restaurant is well appointed, easy to navigate, and clean."
The staff are active and attentive to customers needs. They have a good rapport amongst themselves. Everyone seems to enjoy their work.
The breakfast foods are consistent and well made. Plating is neat and visually stimulating. I really enjoyed the breakfast special this month. With fresh orange juice and a cup of Joe the meal was really satisfying.
"Thank you to the staff here. Happy 4th"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
